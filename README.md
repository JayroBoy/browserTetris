# BrowserTetris
An implementation of tetris using only javascript, CSS and HTML. Based on @kubowania's project.


This project serves a two-fold purpose. I made it as my entrance project to FoG, an extracurricular group that focuses
on gamedev, and I also made it because I am currently attending a webdev class and this seemed like a good way to learn
a lot of concepts in practice. Overall I think it turned out alright, the final result is pretty neat. The javascript
variables and comments are mostly in portuguese and are part comment, part my own notes about the code.

To play the game, open the HTML file in a browser and click the green button. Left and Right arrows move the piece left and right, up and down arrows
rotate the piece clockwise and counter-clockwise, respectively.
